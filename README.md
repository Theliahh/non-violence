# non-violence
A digital version of the non violence test created by Dr. Vinod K. Kool

The Non-Violence Test (NVT) was designed to test a person's tendencies towards making violent vs. non-violent actions in response to common situations. This is being created to replace the physical test to allow for easier, faster, and more environmentally friendly distribution of the NVT.

Created using ASP.NET 5, MVC 6, Typescript, and Angular.JS
