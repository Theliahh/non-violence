<h2>The Non-Violence Test</h2>
<p>
    The Nonviolence test (NVT) was developed by Dr. Vinod K Kool and Dr Manisha Sen to identify
    violent and nonviolent individuals for use in a Milgram-esque study. Individuals with a higher NVT score,
    who are less violent, were less willing to administer shocks to test subjects than those with a lower, more
    violent result.

    <h4>Contents of the test</h4>
    <p>
        The test consists of 65 questions designed to address every aspect of nonviolence to build a final nonviolence score.
        A score, out of 36, is given based on the number of nonviolent answers given during the test. Some questions are filler questions
        and their answers are not counted in the final score.

    <h4>Validity of the NVT</h4>
    <p>The NVT was tested against several other Nonviolence tests to measure its accuracy and validity. These tests include: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Pacifism Scale (PS)</li>
        <li>The Teenage Nonviolence Test (TNT)</li>
        <li>The Gandhian Personality Scale (GPS)</li>
        <li>The Multidimensional Scale of Nonviolence (MSN)</li>
    </ol>
